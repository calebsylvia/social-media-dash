# Build out the social media dashboard prototype we have been given as accurately as possible

# Peer Reviewer: This looks great Caleb! Your design looks very close to the prototype. I think the text for the usernames in the top set of cards should be bolded. And I think the green and red text/arrow icons in the bottom set of cards is a little too big. I think the only things I can see for desktop that differ from the prototype are the small strip of white space at the bottom of the page on dark mode, and the cursor should change from a pointer to a little click hand when you hover over each of the cards. Aside from those two things, this looks really good. Mobile looks good too, but I think you might have just a bit too much padding on the sides of each card compared to the prototype. Well done!
